      <h4>Kate</h4>
      <p class="biotext">Kate has an MSc from Carleton University and thinks that geology is the schist. Her favourite mineral is Halite because she too is a bit
        salty. Kate spent 11 days in the desert, collecting 50 rocks for a 300 page thesis which would take her 2.5 years and one
        dangerous lab accident to complete. She is now pursuing a career in GIS to distance herself from deadly chemicals and to instead
        spend all of her time sitting behind a computer. Just like Carbon, Kate shines under pressure. 
        When Kate grows up she hopes to become a GIS Applications Specialist.</p>

      <p class="biotext">Kazuto received a BSc in geology from Queen's University and has 3 years of experience in the mineral exploration industry. 
        Recently he has discovered a passion for programming and GIS, mainly because you can avoid being eaten alive by blackflies if you are indoors.
        Likes: rock climbing, camping, piano, gaming, beer, tea. Dislikes: raisin cookies, people pronouncing "gif" with a j sound, stepping in a small 
        puddle of water on your kitchen floor and getting one sock wet. Awful experience. Wouldn't wish it on anyone.
